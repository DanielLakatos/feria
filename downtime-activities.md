## Custom Activities
These are the activites I created for you to pick. Might give ides for others, so feel free to think and we can decide on time and gold cost for those. After my custom list there is some list from XGE and also a summary of all sorts of other ideas if you need more.

### **Group Training**  
The party dedicates structured downtime to train together, honing collective combat and support techniques. This involves daily drills, tactical exercises, and guided lessons from masters (or self-taught routines if they’re pioneers in their field). The greater the time invested, the stronger the bonds and benefits become.

---

#### Possible Rewards
1. **Initiative Exchange (2 weeks - 500 gold/person)**
    
    - After rolling initiative, trained allies can swap their positions in the initiative order before combat begins. Once per day, two party members can exchange their initiatives before the combat starts. Cannot be used when surprised.
2. **Shared Spell Slots (2 weeks - 1 000 gold/person)**
    
    - Casters who have trained side-by-side can share a limited portion of their spell energy. Once per long rest, they can transfer spell slots up to half the caster’s level (rounded up), with a maximum level of 5 per slot. Warlocks can only benefit if shared spell is equal to their pact slot, but can share that slot with others (can be helpful if party is preparing a short rest, as the warlock will regain it.)
3. **Combined Skill Checks (2 weeks - 500 gold/person)**
    
    - Once per long rest, two characters with the relevant skill can combine their skill modifiers on a single check, representing them working in perfect tandem.
4. **Shared Actions (4 weeks - 1 000 gold/person)**
    
    - Once per day, the group gains a “team action”. A person can forgo their action and bonus action this turn, to grant the other person an immediate action they can take in that moment. The granted action is limited to Attack, Cast a spell, Dash, Hide. Alternatively the other person can regain their spent reaction (thus allowing perhaps a person with Counterspell to counter two spell as reactions, if party member sacrifices their turn).
5. **Modified Pack Tactics (8 weeks - 2 000 gold/person) - full party needed**
    
    - When allies stand adjacent to the same target, they gain advantage on attack rolls. This needs 3 people from the party working together.
6. **Shared Feat Acquisition (8 weeks - 3 000 gold/person)  - full party needed**
    
    - Each character learns a new feat that suits their personal growth
7. **COMBO (8 weeks - 3 000 gold/person)  - full party needed**
    
    - Once per long rest, two characters can combine their turns into one in initiative. They both need to have their turn still remaining in the round, but the person in a later initiative can 'jump ahead'. They can both move in motion and collaborate on some combo. Additionally, if targeting the same person with an attack or cast a spell action (melee/ranged attack, melee/ranged spell attack, spell target for saving through excluding area of effect skills and up to DM discretion if allowed) they can choose to have the following effect. One person focuses on misdirecting the attention of the target. This causes the other person to strike with advantage, or the target gaining disadvantage on the saving throw against the other person's attack (only the first roll, so if for example the case of multi attack or saving throw as part of an attack, only the first roll gets this treatment). This comes at the price of the person doing the misdirecting to gain disadvantage on their roll, or the target gaining advantage on their saving throw against the misdirecting targets spell.
8. **Miraculous Rally (10 weeks - 5 000 gold/person) - full party needed**
    
    - One singular time in the campaign, the party can rally together, spend 1 minute, gain the following effects:
	    - Heal up to (5 * number of people * party average level) spread across as needed.
	    - Gain (party level + 10) temporary hit points each (replacing current ones)
	    - Gain back all feature and item charges that recharge on a short rest (like Ki points for a monk)
	    - Each person can choose one of the following:
		    - Gain 5 level of spells back (can be one 5th level or multiple slots adding up to 5)
		    - The first attack roll you make is with advantage, and it gains 2d8 force damage as extra damage
		    - Gain 10 feet extra movement for one hour
9. **Level up (12 weeks - (new level * 1000) gold/person, so to get to level 10 its 10 000 gold/person) - full party needed**
    
    - Everyone levels up

### **Solo Activities**  
The individual members use time on their own to gain benefits on their own. Besides the usual list found for downtime activities and player ideas here are some extra thoughts and ideas:


1. **Retrain (2 weeks - 500 gold/2 week)**
    
    - Move 1 ability score per 2 weeks spent.
2. **Expertise (4 weeks - 2500 gold)**
    
    - Gain expertise in a skill you have proficiency in.
3. **Proficiency (Varies - Varies)**
    
    - Gain proficiency in a weapon, tool or skill.
4. **Research (4 weeks - 1000 gold)**
    
    - Start with increased knowledge in the topics Act 2 will touch.

### Example Downtime Activities

The following activities are suitable for any character who can afford to pursue them. As DM, you have the final say on which activities are available to the characters. The activities you allow might depend on the nature of the area where the characters are located. For example, you might disallow the creation of magic items or decide that the characters are in a town that is too isolated from major markets for them to buy such items.

See the following entries for details:
